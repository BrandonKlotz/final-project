Senti is a sentiment analysis app to assist you in writing professional emails.

Paste or type your text into the free web app and hit the ANALYZE button.

Senti uses the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer API to detect language and emotional tones in your email or text message. 

Watson was used last year to measure the emotional tones projected by each candidate in the series of presidential debates.

In Senti, messages are examined to see if they use confident or analytical language and whether the tone conveyed is happy, sad, apprehensive, or angry.

Tone is an important component of business communication that is easily overlooked. Most of us use spelling and grammar checkers but do not consider if our tone is professional.

People are much more likely to perceive negative emotions with greater intensity than they do positive emotions.

To ensure the tone of your message is positive and professional, Senti does both an overall document analysis and a sentence-by-sentence review.
